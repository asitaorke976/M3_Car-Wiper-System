## Abstract
We present a control system for controlling automobile wipers using the STM32F4xx-discovery board in this project. Because the STM32F4xx-discovery doesn't have a motor, we are exploring the use of LEDs in this application instead of a DC motor. Taking the wiper control system as an example, the STM32F4xx-discovery board has four LEDs and a push button. The LEDs are orange, green, red, and blue. To make a push button work with the STM32F407VG microcontroller, the GPIO pins will be set as digital input pins. Four user LEDs are connected to PD12, PD13, PD14, and PD15 through a current limiting resistor. When the ignition key is positioned at the ACC, the LED illuminates. Additionally, the LEDs flicker, indicating that the wipers are on. Push and hold the user button for two seconds.
A wiper is a necessary component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. In the past, wipers had to be activated manually, which made bringing them up difficult to manage. To address these issues, this method is proposed. By giving an automated transmission to older automobiles, the project aims to improve their systems.
The goal of the project is to enhance the wiping system by adding a sensor and an actuator, as well as to create a software that can work with the system on a complete level
This proposed wiper system's principle is similar to those of other conventional wipers.
